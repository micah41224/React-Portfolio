# 20-React-Portfolio

## Project Description:

This week's homework required that we create a new portfolio for our work that is to be crafted using React. This portfolio must include the sections: About Me, Porfolio (our projects), Contact and Resume. Only one section is to be loaded to the page at a time. We must include a navbar with links to all the sections and the page must load with the About Me section showing. The link on the navbar that corresponds to the currently loaded page must be highlighted.

## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, jQuery, React-hook-form, React-toastify, Email.js
